# Server-APIs-Weather-Dashboard

- AS A traveler
- I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
- SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## The App Should

- Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
- When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
- When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
- The city name
- The date
- An icon representation of weather conditions
- The temperature
- The humidity
- The wind speed
- When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
- The date
- An icon representation of weather conditions
- The temperature
- The humidity
- When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
